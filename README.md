# StaffTrack WebAPI & WebUI
 
This repository contains the backend and frontend for the yolo-dlib-face-recognition repository that can be found here:  https://github.com/r4tylmz/yolo-dlib-face-recognition

## How to start the backend server?
Inside of the StaffTrack.WebAPI folder:

1- Open a terminal (bash or cmd)

2- Type `dotnet run` or if you need a hot-reload feature use this instead: `` dotnet watch run ``

```Note that you need to install .Net 5 on your operating system before using this.```

## How to start the frontend server?
Inside of the StaffTrack.WebUI folder:

1- Open a terminal (bash or cmd)

2- You need to install the node modules first as this repository doesn't have any node modules in it. So type `` yarn install `` command. This command will install all of the dependencies related to the project for you.

3- Start the server on localhost using the `` yarn serve `` command.

```Note that you need to install Node.JS on your operating system before using this.```
